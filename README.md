### Home page

The home page showcases the current promotional image as the main element along with some descriptive text.

### About page

The about page has information about the brand identity as well as options for contacting.

### Your Rewards page

This page allows the user to learn about the brand rewards scheme by clicking 'learn about rewards'.

It also lets the user 'register' which places the details into a state in order to log in straight after with the same details.

This does not store multiple log-ins so make sure to register and log in in one session.

### Products page

This page showcases 10 beauty products that you can select a colour for and add to cart. The cart page only pops up when an item is added.

### Cart page

The cart page shows the user's chosen products for checkout. The user can either empty cart or complete the order.

Extra details on shipping is available upon clicking 'shipping info' and the user is able to click 'complete order!' only once the shipping has been selected from the dropdown menu.
